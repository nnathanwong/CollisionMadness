The purpose of this game is to try to get all ten balls to collide with another ball at least once.

HOW TO PLAY:
You can move the paddle (rectangle at the bottom of the screen) left or right by using your mouse. The paddle will prevent
the balls from hitting the bottom of the screen. If a ball hits the bottom of the screen, it disappears. If the gold, larger ball
hits the bottom of the screen, a game over occurs.
The gold, larger ball, upon hitting the paddle, will spawn a black, small ball. These small balls can hit the bottom of the screen
but will disappear upon doing so. The gold ball can spawn up to nine other black balls.
Each time a ball hits the paddle, that ball's movement speed will increase and its x-direction will flip.
Each time a ball collides with another ball, it will turn green (including the gold ball). When this happens, your score increases
by two if both balls were not green, by one if one of the balls were not green, or by none if both balls were already green.
If a green, small ball hits the bottom of the screen, the ball will disappear and your score will decrease by one.
However, if the large ball hits the bottom of the screen (despite being green), the game immediately ends.
In order to achieve victory, you must reach a score of 10, which indicates that you have made all balls change color to green.
